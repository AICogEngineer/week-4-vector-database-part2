# Monday: Document Processing & RAG Pipelines

## Exercise Schedule

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Prerequisites |
|----------|------|----------|---------------|
| 01: Text Preprocessing | Implementation | 60-75 min | Reading 03, Demo 01 |
| 02: Chunking Experiment | Implementation | 75-90 min | Reading 04-05, Demo 02 |

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Build a complete text preprocessing pipeline for RAG systems
- Implement multiple chunking strategies (fixed, sentence, recursive)
- Measure and compare retrieval quality across strategies
- Determine optimal chunk sizes for your use case

## Before You Begin

1. **Complete the readings** in `readings/1-Monday/`
2. **Watch/run demos** in `demos/1-Monday/code/`
3. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Exercises

### Exercise 01: Text Preprocessing (Implementation)
See [exercise_01_text_preprocessing.md](exercise_01_text_preprocessing.md)
Starter code: `starter_code/exercise_01_starter.py`

Build a production-ready text preprocessing pipeline to clean messy documents before embedding.

### Exercise 02: Chunking Experiment (Implementation)
See [exercise_02_chunking_experiment.md](exercise_02_chunking_experiment.md)
Starter code: `starter_code/exercise_02_starter.py`

Experiment with different chunking strategies, measure their impact on retrieval quality, and document your findings.

## Estimated Time
**Total: 2.5-3 hours**
