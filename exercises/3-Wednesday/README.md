# Wednesday: Deployment & Optimization

## Exercise Schedule

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Prerequisites |
|----------|------|----------|---------------|
| 01: Persistent Deployment | Implementation | 60-75 min | Reading 01-02, Demo 01 |
| 02: Performance Optimization | Implementation | 75-90 min | Reading 03-05, Demo 02-03 |

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Configure persistent local vector database storage
- Implement backup and recovery strategies
- Identify performance bottlenecks in vector operations
- Apply optimization techniques (batching, caching, index tuning)

## Before You Begin

1. **Complete the readings** in `readings/3-Wednesday/`
2. **Watch/run demos** in `demos/3-Wednesday/code/`
3. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Exercises

### Exercise 01: Persistent Deployment (Implementation)
See [exercise_01_persistent_deployment.md](exercise_01_persistent_deployment.md)
Starter code: `starter_code/exercise_01_starter.py`

Configure a production-ready persistent vector database with proper data management and recovery capabilities.

### Exercise 02: Performance Optimization (Implementation)
See [exercise_02_performance_optimization.md](exercise_02_performance_optimization.md)
Starter code: `starter_code/exercise_02_starter.py`

Analyze and optimize a slow-performing vector search system following best practices.

## Estimated Time
**Total: 2.5-3 hours**
